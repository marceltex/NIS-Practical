# NIS-Practical
Repository for our NIS Practical Assignment

Can everyone please work on a seperate branch when implementing new features, then we will merge the branches into master at the end. If we all work on master, managing the code will be very messy.

## External Libraries Used for Project
* Bouncy Castle Provider - http://www.bouncycastle.org/download/bcprov-jdk15on-154.jar
* Bouncy Castle PKIX/CMS/EAC/PKCS/OCSP/TSP/OPENSSL - http://www.bouncycastle.org/download/bcpkix-jdk15on-154.jar
* Bouncy Castle OpenPGP/BCPG - http://www.bouncycastle.org/download/bcpg-jdk15on-154.jar

*We probably won't need all 3 of the above libraries. I'm just adding them for now in case we need them later. We can always remove the libraries we didn't use at the end.*

## Development Environment Used to Setup Project
**Netbeans 8.1 with Java 8u77**
